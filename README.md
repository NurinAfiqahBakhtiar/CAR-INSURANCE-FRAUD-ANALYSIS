# This is the mini project report that are made by me and my friends. This project consists of 3 objectives, which are:

## 1) To identify which policyholder demographic is most strongly influences the likelihood of a claim being fraudulent.
### • Are certain marital statuses (e.g., single, married) more associated with fraudulent claims? 
### • Do male and female policyholders differ in their frequency of fraudulent claim submissions?
### • How does the driver’s rating influence the likelihood of a fraudulent insurance claim?

## 2) To analyse how features of a car or vehicle might increase or decrease the chances of someone committing insurance fraud. 
### • Are older vehicles more likely to be involved in fraudulent claims comapred to newer ones? 
### • How does vehicle price range affect the frequency of fraud cases? 
### • What are the most common vehicle makes involved in fraudulent claims? 

## 3) To explore policy-related and procedural factors in insurance fraud. 
### • What is the fraud rate for different policy types (e.g., Sport – Collision, Sedan – All Perils)? 
### • How does the presence or absence of police reports and witnesses relate to fraud detection? 
### • What is the overall fraud distribution based on accident areas (urban vs rural)? 
### • Do claims handled by internal or external agents show different fraud patterns?
